# primeGenerator
Method to get all prime numbers in a range

The program works by creating a list with all the numbers in a designated range, changing the value of the 1st value to 0 and iterating through the list 4 times, first removing every multiple of 2 by skipping every number after 2 by 2 places, then doing the same for 3, 5 and 7, before using the filter to remove all 0s from the list
